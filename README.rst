FREQ
==========================================

Introduction

FREQ is build to do some simple statistical analyses on groundwater timeseries. It contains trend detection, analysis of periodic fluctuations, and an autoregressive model.


Post-nensskel setup TODO
------------------------

Here are some instructions on what to do after you've created the project with
nensskel.

- Add a new jenkins job at
  http://buildbot.lizardsystem.nl/jenkins/view/djangoapps/newJob or
  http://buildbot.lizardsystem.nl/jenkins/view/libraries/newJob . Job name
  should be "freq", make the project a copy of the existing "lizard-wms"
  project (for django apps) or "nensskel" (for libraries). On the next page,
  change the "github project" to ``https://github.com/nens/freq/`` and
  "repository url" fields to ``git@github.com:nens/freq.git`` (you might
  need to replace "nens" with "lizardsystem"). The rest of the settings should
  be OK.

- The project is prepared to be translated with Lizard's
  `Transifex <http://translations.lizard.net/>`_ server. For details about
  pushing translation files to and fetching translation files from the
  Transifex server, see the ``nens/translations`` `documentation
  <https://github.com/nens/translations/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
