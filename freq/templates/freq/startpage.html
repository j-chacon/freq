      Time series analysis are applied for monitoring the impact of abstraction
      and climate change on groundwater levels. This tool help to understand
      temporal changes of groundwater levels. The time series analysis
      consist of detection of trends; estimation of periodic component an
      autoregressive model. Based on this information it also provides an
      estimate on the monitoring sampling frequency, which is one of the key
      components of good groundwater monitoring network design.
